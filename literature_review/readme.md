# Literature Review Checklist: Semantic Caching in LLMs

## 1. Research Question
- [ ] Define: "How do recent advancements in semantic caching, particularly SCALM and MeanCache, improve the efficiency and performance of Large Language Model applications?"

## 2. Literature Search
- [ ] Locate SCALM paper (arXiv:2406.00025)
- [ ] Locate MeanCache paper (arXiv:2403.02694)
- [ ] Search for additional related papers cited by SCALM and MeanCache
- [ ] Look for papers that have cited SCALM and MeanCache since their publication

## 3. Analysis of SCALM
- [ ] Summarize key contributions
- [ ] Note the use of real-world human-LLM interaction data
- [ ] Analyze the proposed semantics-oriented cache architecture
- [ ] Examine the hierarchical semantic clustering methods
- [ ] Understand the new metric: total token saving ratio
- [ ] Review performance improvements (63% cache hit ratio increase, 77% token savings)

## 4. Analysis of MeanCache
- [ ] Summarize key contributions
- [ ] Examine the user-centric approach and local caching
- [ ] Analyze the use of Federated Learning for privacy preservation
- [ ] Understand the context chain encoding for cached queries
- [ ] Review performance improvements (17% higher F-score, 20% precision increase)
- [ ] Note storage reduction (83%) and decision acceleration (11%)

## 5. Comparative Analysis
- [ ] Identify common themes between SCALM and MeanCache
- [ ] List key differences in approaches
- [ ] Compare performance metrics and evaluation methods
- [ ] Analyze strengths and limitations of each approach

## 6. Broader Context
- [ ] Relate SCALM and MeanCache to previous work in semantic caching
- [ ] Discuss implications for LLM applications and services
- [ ] Identify potential impact on LLM efficiency and cost reduction

## 7. Gaps and Future Directions
- [ ] List unanswered questions or limitations in current approaches
- [ ] Suggest potential areas for future research
- [ ] Consider possible combinations or extensions of SCALM and MeanCache approaches

## 8. Writing the Review
- [ ] Draft introduction and background on semantic caching in LLMs
- [ ] Write detailed summaries of SCALM and MeanCache
- [ ] Develop a comparative analysis section
- [ ] Discuss broader implications and future directions
- [ ] Write conclusion summarizing key findings

## 9. Review and Refinement
- [ ] Check for comprehensive coverage of both papers
- [ ] Ensure critical analysis rather than mere summary
- [ ] Verify all claims are supported by evidence from the papers
- [ ] Proofread for clarity, coherence, and academic style

## 10. Citations and References
- [ ] Properly cite SCALM and MeanCache papers
- [ ] Include citations for any additional sources used
- [ ] Format references according to required citation style
