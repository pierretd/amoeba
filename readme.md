# AMOEBA: Advanced Multi-Objective Embedding-Based Adaptive cache for Large Language Models

## Overview
The rapid advancement of semantic caching systems in AI powered application has led to significant improvements in the efficiency and scalability of interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite these improvements, optimizing cache performance while balancing multiple objectives such as performance, cost, and speed remains a challenging and time-consuming task. This project explores the potential of developing scalable techniques to facilitate advanced caching mechanisms and provide insights into their operational processes. 

To address these challenges, we propose a novel caching framework named **AMOEBA: Advanced Multi-Objective Embedding-Based Adaptive Cache for Large Language Models**. Inspired by recent advancements in semantic caching like [SCALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00025) and [MeanCache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694), **AMOEBA** integrates adaptive caching, multi-objective optimization, and evaluation frameworks to create a highly efficient, scalable, and user-centric caching solution for AI-powered applications. 

Our contributions include introducing a hybrid adaptive caching mechanism, developing predictive pre-caching models, implementing evaluation frameworks for data driven caching, and designing a distributed edge-cloud architecture to enhance scalability.

Key features of AMOEBA include:
- Dynamic adaptive caching mechanisms
- Multi-objective optimization balancing performance, privacy, and adaptability
- Scalable architecture for distributed caching across edge devices and cloud infrastructure
